# Match Activation UI Simplification

## Overview
This package contains the UI improvements for the match activation page to make it less overwhelming for casual players while maintaining full functionality for advanced users.

## Problem Solved

## Solution Implemented
- **Simplified Default View**: Shows only essential elements (PIN input, player selection, action buttons)
- **Collapsible Details**: All detailed information hidden behind a "Show Details" button
- **Consistent UX**: Similar to the "Show Advanced" pattern used in Friendly Games
